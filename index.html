          Hi, my name is Vinny Ratatattat, but most people know me as Pizza Rat.<br>
          Now don’t go thinking that I’m trying to convince you of anything; after all, your opinions are none of my business.But its been over 4 years since Matt Little released that video and I thought it was time to finally provide some insight.<br>
          When you live below the streets of New York City with millions of other rats, you learn to fend for yourself pretty quickly especially when your the youngest of your litter.<br>
          Luckily for me I had an uncle who was trained master of martial arts who taught me everything I needed to know. And yes, I am talking about the one and only Master Splinter, the foster father of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and I guess that’s where my love for pizza really began.<br>
          So, let’s go back to the day of the infamous video. I was hanging out with TMNT at the L train station when Michaelangelo spotted an abandoned slice cheese pizza by the stairs. He triple dog dared me to drag the slice down the stairs and into the tracks in order to receive a years supply of my favorite pizza. I couldn’t turn down the dare especially with pizza on the line. So that’s what I attempted to do and you pretty much know the rest.
